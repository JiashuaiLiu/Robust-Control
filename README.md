1. MuSynthesisDesign.m

   This is a test file. This is pseudo-code about mu synthesis control. Note: The code may not work and is for reference only. 

   The corresponding architecture is "mu-synthesis control based on reference model". The D-K iteration is performed by MATLAB. And the MATLAB function command is 

   ```matlab
   [K,CLperf] = musyn(P,nmeas,ncont)
   ```
